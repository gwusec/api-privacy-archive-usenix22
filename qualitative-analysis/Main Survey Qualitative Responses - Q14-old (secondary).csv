206,"I don't have concerns about google, which is why I gave them access",,,,,,,,
207,,,,,,,,,

218,My only concern is if it shares my files with others.,,,,,,,,
219,"I don't really trust them as a company, however, I had gotten my account hacked and so that was part of why I ended up linking it. I wanted to be able to resecure my account and linking it this way was one way to ensure it couldn't get hacked again.",,,,,,,,
220,My primary concern is that my privacy and information may be leaked to other third-parties that may use my information to send me ads or unwanted information (spam mail).,,,,,,,,
221,dropbox has held my personal photos. I hope these are always private. Dropbox shouldnt have access to my friends' email addresses and phone numbers and dates of birth and all the info i keep in personal contacts,,,,,,,,
222,"I don't have any real concerns about Mailbird having access to this information, I know why they need the information and the app was very transparent about needing my permission to access this information. The only slight concern I would have is if the app had some sort of error or bug happen that would delete something that I did not request, however I have confidence in this app that this would be a very rare occurrence.",,,,,,,,

236,,,,,,,,,
237,,,,,,,,,
238,"The control they have over contacts and the different thing they can do with contacts is concerning. Seeing contacts is actually really nice because then it helps you find connections and I would guess that's all they use that access for (and maybe to advertise to contacts) but still it seems like they wouldn't need anything more than the ability to see contacts.
 Personal info isn't too concerning, this seems pretty typical, but still surprising how easily LinkedIn can access it.",,,,,,,,
