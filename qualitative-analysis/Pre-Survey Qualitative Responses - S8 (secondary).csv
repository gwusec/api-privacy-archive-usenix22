456,i didn't think of anything when i used it,,,,,,,,
458,,,,,,,,,
459,The dread that comes with Google selling my information,,,,,,,,
461,whether it would be more secure to sign in directly with the app using a new password,,,,,,,,
462,Nothing because I know it's safe,,,,,,,,
463,If I should link the account or just put in the email.,,,,,,,,
464,I was considering if I use my Gmail to login or my Facebook account.,,,,,,,,
465,Absolutely nothing. I just signed in,,,,,,,,
466,if my own handle would be better,,,,,,,,
468,I considered the trustworthiness of the developers and the risk of getting spammed.,,,,,,,,
469,"Nothing, I did it without any consideration besides the fact that it'd make it easier to play the game. As long as a site doesn't ask for my password directly, I trust Google's sign-in process.",,,,,,,,
470,"I preferred to sign in through Facebook, but Facebook sign-up wasn't working.",,,,,,,,
471,Simplicity of having everything being connected to one account. It keeps everything consistent.,,,,,,,,
474,privacy,,,,,,,,
475,How my information will be used by the app and whether I will receive more emails because of it.,,,,,,,,
476,"i considered my privacy but because twitter is a very mainstream service, I consider it secure.",,,,,,,,
477,storing password,,,,,,,,
479,I considered what information will be shared between my Google account and my spotify account.,,,,,,,,
480,"I feel like it's a safer and less intrusive sign in action than signing in with Facebook, which has loads of personal information.",,,,,,,,
483,I also thought about using the facebook option since I think I had used that in the past too,,,,,,,,
484,I considered if I really wanted to make an account to see the items I wanted to view or if I wanted to view it just the one time.,,,,,,,,
485,I was worried that any additional information irrelevant to the service I was using for was going to be utilized for purposes beyond what was intended. Such as access to my contacts and stuff I am interested in.,,,,,,,,
486,I may have wondered whether or not it was safe.,,,,,,,,
487,"Whether I wanted to start up a new account and password to access this online news source and be able to comment, and also whether I wanted to access it through apple or google or whatever others options available.",,,,,,,,
488,Using traditional email/password login.,,,,,,,,
489,"I considered whether the company would be trustworthy with my data. Since the game is well known, I decided it is okay.",,,,,,,,
490,I thought about what website I was using and how trustworthy it is.,,,,,,,,
491,Whether or not I wanted the abundance of emails I would get after allowing that site to have access to my email address.,,,,,,,,
493,I considered using Facebook instead,,,,,,,,
496,I considered if I should use my personal gmail account or one of my work issued accounts instead.,,,,,,,,
497,nothing,,,,,,,,
498,"I don't think I really considered much, besides that it would be quicker to sign in with Google than to create a whole Etsy account by putting in my email and information.",,,,,,,,
499,What information I would be allowing the third-party to see,,,,,,,,
501,nothing,,,,,,,,
502,,,,,,,,,
503,"Honestly, I considered that I would not have to remember my passoword.",,,,,,,,
504,I considered creating a login specifically for Instacart.,,,,,,,,
505,I always check to see what permissions that a third-party service is gaining access to.,,,,,,,,
507,I considered the fact that I may want to stop using Google services one day and that there's no way to unlink my google account from the service.,,,,,,,,
508,Whether the app would send me a bunch of emails,,,,,,,,
509,Do i already have a seperate account that isn't tied to a google account? Is this site important enough to me to warrant a separate-from-google account?,,,,,,,,
510,I thought about privacy and security,,,,,,,,
511,nothing,,,,,,,,
512,"I didn't really consider it, I just did it because it was easier than creating another account.",,,,,,,,
513,my time,,,,,,,,
514,I considered setting up a separate account without linking my Google account to the third-party app or service.,,,,,,,,
515,I thought if I wanted this to be associated with my email and whether the acccount maybe warranted stronger security than my gmail account,,,,,,,,
516,"How convenient Google already has my stored information, I would not need to type it out myself",,,,,,,,
517,I didn't consider anything.,,,,,,,,
518,How it's more convenient to sign in using my Google Account,,,,,,,,
519,The security risks of linking my account to another party's data,,,,,,,,
521,I considered it to be more convenient. Using google is preferable because it means one less account to maintain.,,,,,,,,
522,"I considered the convenience, since I knew offhand my GMail password.",,,,,,,,
523,I considered if the service is trustworthy.,,,,,,,,
527,I considered how often I would use the service before signing in with Google Account.,,,,,,,,
528,creating a new account,,,,,,,,
529,"I considered how easy/difficult it would be to set up my own account, whether it would be a security risk to connect my Google account, who would access my data and which kinds of data, how often I would use the game (whether these risks were ""worth"" it for the convenience of easily logging in to play)",,,,,,,,
530,n/a,,,,,,,,
532,How the third-party website may be using my Google login information and whether or not it is necessary for me to log in using Google.,,,,,,,,
533,I was wondering it was worth my time to sign in and if it was a safe sight to sign in to.,,,,,,,,
536,Trying to remember my password and username,,,,,,,,
537,I considered how difficult the signup process for the third-party app would be and if just logging into it with my Google Account would be faster.,,,,,,,,
538,,,,,,,,,
539,Whether that website would be able to see my emails and such,,,,,,,,
540,Convenience,,,,,,,,
542,I thought about how much I trusted the website I was using google to sign into and if I was comfortable signing in with my google account. I decided it was fine and did.,,,,,,,,
543,nothing,,,,,,,,
544,am I okay sharing my data,,,,,,,,
545,I considered what could possibly happen if someone malicious gained access to that account.,,,,,,,,
547,I wondered if my data would be safe.,,,,,,,,
548,"I considered whether the app or service was trustworthy, and I also considered how often I would use this app.",,,,,,,,
549,Is it safe and secure?,,,,,,,,
550,Didn't consider anything really,,,,,,,,
552,Is it safe just because it's faster?,,,,,,,,
553,This is probably going to save me a lot of time. I'm not too concerned with theft because I have nothing of value.,,,,,,,,
554,"If there are other options like I previously mentioned, I mostly use Apple log-in or my own, but if I am using Google, then I think about the type of website/app it is and my privacy.",,,,,,,,
555,"I knew I would already have to use that email address to generate a login anyway, so it seemed efficient to use the third-party sign in option.",,,,,,,,
556,The one thing I considered was the efficiency of signing into it by just a press of a button rather than going through the sign in process.,,,,,,,,
557,Why not just sign in with a email?,,,,,,,,
558,"Not much. I mainly use the email for gaming content,",,,,,,,,
559,Mostly convenience and the fact that I'm less likely to forget or lose account information.,,,,,,,,
561,I considered that I didn't want to use Facebook.,,,,,,,,
562,"I considered if the site would have access to my contacts. Since Google owns Youtube, I did not really care .",,,,,,,,
564,I considered my privacy and security.,,,,,,,,
566,"What portions of my account the service would have access to (location, media, contacts, etc.), how often I would get marketing information from the service through that email, what information could be exposed if the service was hacked, how often I would use Google services like adding calendar appointments, submitting payment info, or sharing posts to my contacts.",,,,,,,,
569,I considered if I trusted the company w/ my account info.,,,,,,,,
570,If my information would be shared.,,,,,,,,
574,What information about me they would get from me connecting my account,,,,,,,,
575,I was thinking about logging in with an email and password because I didn't want my personal information to be linked.,,,,,,,,
577,Whether I used that last time or had a regular password,,,,,,,,
580,"The app itself, and whether it is reputable.",,,,,,,,
581,my account security,,,,,,,,
582,Using Google to sign in is convenient.,,,,,,,,
583,,,,,,,,,
585,whether I wanted tons of spam from that service,,,,,,,,
588,I have used this single sign on for a while and this is a preferred method. I think about taking extra precautions to secure my google account since using single sign on makes things less secure. Overall it makes things a lot easier and more enjoyable to use.,,,,,,,,
589,What permissions it has to my google account,,,,,,,,
590,I thought about how they would have access to my information. Just like you might.,,,,,,,,
591,My data being shared and exploited.,,,,,,,,
592,If the site was reputable.,,,,,,,,
593,How much easier and convenient it is to use.,,,,,,,,
594,,,,,,,,,
595,Security risks,,,,,,,,
598,"Risk versus reward. I worry a little about giving an app access to my personal information, but, to be honest, if I think I could get money back from something (like the receipt apps) it definitely convinces me a little more. If the app looks shady to me I won't do it, but if it seems relatively legitimate and has good reviews, I'm probably willing.",,,,,,,,
600,That I wanted to sign in.,,,,,,,,
