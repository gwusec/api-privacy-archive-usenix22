435,I didn't consider much,,,,,,,,
436,"I didn't consider anything, I just said yes",,,,,,,,
437,I had to consider what it would see and look at as a result of connecting it.,,,,,,,,
439,Convenience as well as what the app collected and stored played a role in my decision.,,,,,,,,

442,I considered if there was sensitive information I would not want shared.,,,,,,,,

557,Is this trust worthy?,,,,,,,,
558,Did not think much about out. I dont keep my personal information in emails. I write it in a book,,,,,,,,
559,I'm more restrictive about giving outside apps access to my Google. I think much more about the quality and privacy of the website and how much access it's requesting.,,,,,,,,
561,,,,,,,,,

594,,,,,,,,,
595,Nothing,,,,,,,,

600,I don't recall.,,,,,,,,
595,Security risks,,,,,,,,
598,"Risk versus reward. I worry a little about giving an app access to my personal information, but, to be honest, if I think I could get money back from something (like the receipt apps) it definitely convinces me a little more. If the app looks shady to me I won't do it, but if it seems relatively legitimate and has good reviews, I'm probably willing.",,,,,,,,
600,That I wanted to sign in.,,,,,,,,
