# Qualitative coding
This folder contains coded responses to the free-response questions in the
pre-survey and main survey.
 
For submitted responses (i.e., rows with non-blank entries in the second row),
there will be one or more codes from the primary and secondary coders. Codes
are in the columns headed with `Code 1`, `Code 2`, etc. 

Some codes have sub-codes to specify further details, such as
`permissions->correct` to denote checking that permissions are correct.Any
row containing sub-codes will also have the top-level code (such as
`permissions`) in another column.

## Pre-survey

Pre-survey CSVs are from their respective tables in `Pre-Survey Qualitative Responses.xlsx`.
The source Excel file also contains all codes (with counts) for each pre-survey qualitative
question.

## Main survey

Main survey CSVs are from their respective tables in `Main Survey Qualitative Responses.xlsx`.
The source Excel file also contains all codes (with counts) for each main survey qualitative
question.

### App-specific questions

The main survey uses a browser extension to obtain a list of participants'
app authorizations on their Google account. The survey uses this data to ask
about participants' specific apps: the oldest app, the newest app, and a
randomly selected app. For participants with only 1 app, it will be recorded
as the oldest app. For participants with only 2 apps, those will be recorded
as the oldest and newest apps.

#### Main Survey Qualitative Responses - Q14-{old|new|rand}.csv

>Q14. Please describe any concerns you have about the {oldest/newest/random}
>app holding these permissions.

Discussed in **Section 4.2 Awareness and Understanding: Reasons for Concern** in the paper.

###  Reflection

The main survey asks participants:

>In six months do you see yourself reviewing  third-party apps from your
>"Apps with access to your account" page?
>-Yes
>-No
>-Unsure

Participants who respond "Yes" are then presented free-response questions Q19
and Q20.

>access to your account" page. Please describe which settings would you change.
