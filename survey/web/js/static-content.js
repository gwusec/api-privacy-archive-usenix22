        The following information is provided to inform you about the research project and your participation in it.
        Your participation in this research study is voluntary. You are free to withdraw from this study at any time
        prior to submitting the survey.
    </p>
    <h5>
        1. Purpose of the Study
    </h5>
    <p>
        You are being asked to participate in a research study investigating people's awareness and concerns about 
        third-party applications with Google account access. This page will give you key information to help you 
        decide whether or not you want to participate
    </p>
    <p>
        The goal of this research is to measure your experience with Google&rsquo;s "Apps with access to your account" 
        and third-party applications linked to your Google account.
    </p>
    <p>
        It will require that you install a web browser extension, which we provide instructions for removing at the end of the study.
    </p>
    <h5>
        2. Who Is Eligible to Participate?
    </h5>
    <p>
        You may be asked a set of screener questions that will determine eligibility. Based on your responses you may be
        invited back to participate in a larger study. If you are eligible, we will contact you through Prolific in one
        to two weeks to complete the larger study.
    </p>
    <p>
        This study requires the use of a <i>Chrome</i>, <i>Firefox</i> or <i>Edge</i> browser on a desktop or laptop computer. You
        may not participate on a mobile device or tablet, or using a <i>Safari</i> browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must be at least 18 years or older to participate in this study.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
        3. Description of Procedures to Be Followed and Approximate Time Duration Involved for the Participants
    </h5>
    <p>
        The screening survey should take approximately 2 minutes to complete, and no more than 5 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main study should take approximately 15 minutes to complete. The main study
        will ask participants to follow detailed step-by-step instructions for the installation of a web browser
        extension. At the end of the study you will be provided with detailed instructions for the removal of the web
        browser extension. 
    </p>
    <h5>
        4. Expected Costs
    </h5>
    <p>
        There are no costs for your participation.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
        5. Description of the Discomforts, Inconveniences, and/or Risks That Can Be Reasonably Expected as a Result of
        Participation
    </h5>
    <p>
        You will be asked as part of the main study to install a web browser extension that works on the desktop
        versions of <i>Chrome</i>, <i>Firefox</i> or <i>Edge</i>. The web browser extension will analyze your Google's "Apps with access to your account"
        locally in your browser and will not be released to the researchers as part of your data record. Only your study
        responses are collected as well as the types of permissions provided to third-party applications (e.g., &ldquo;has 
        access to Google Drive&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;has access to Google Calendar&rdquo;), the number of third-party applications 
        linked, and the date of the newest and oldest third-party application linked. 
    </p>
    <p>
        We will collect data about the types of permissions, such as whether an app has access to 
        Google Photo albums or has access to Google contacts, but will never collect data from you 
        about the specific third-party applications linked to your Google account. All specific data 
        will be stored locally on your machine and never transmitted to the researchers 
    </p>
    <p>
        There is always risk installing software on your computer. We have designed and extensively 
        tested the web browser extension to only access the Google's "Apps with access to your account", and once the 
        web browser extension is removed, all local analyzed information is also removed. We will also 
        give detailed directions on how to remove the web browser extension.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are uncomfortable installing web browser extensions, we suggest you do not consent and do not complete
        the screener questions nor the main study.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is also a risk of loss of confidentiality. We will ensure that your research record is not linked to any
        personal information, and we will also remove any inadvertent personal information you may include in a long
        form response. 
    </p>
    <h5>
        6. Anticipated Benefits From This Study
    </h5>
    <p>
        Through the course of the study, you may become more aware of how to manage and access your Google's "Apps with access to your account"
        page. Additionally, your participation will help to advance new designs for personal information management.
    </p>
    
    <h5>
        7. Compensation for Participation
    </h5>
    <p>
        You will be compensated $1.00 for completion of the screener questionnaire. If you are invited back to complete
        the main study, you will be compensated $3.00. Total compensation is $4.00 for completing the screening survey
        and the main study.
    </p>
    <h5>
        8. Circumstances Under Which the Principal Investigator May Withdraw You From the Study
    </h5>
    <p>
        If you complete the screener questions but are not invited to the main survey, you are not withdrawn from the
        study, and your responses are still considered. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If you fail attention tests or other checks in the screener questions or main survey, you may be withdrawn from
        the study by either having your data removed and/or rejecting your responses in the survey system.
    </p>
    <h5>
        9. What Happens if You Choose to Withdraw From the Study
    </h5>
    <p>
        You may withdraw from the study at any point prior to the final submission of the screener questions and/or the
        main study. Upon withdrawal your partially completed survey data will be removed and will not be used in the
        study.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to withdraw from the screener questions, you may just abandon the survey and not complete it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you wish to withdraw from the main study, you need to click the &ldquo;opt-out&rdquo; button which will
        provide instructions for removing the web browser extension. Once removed, you may abandon the survey.
    </p>
    <p>
        In both cases we ask that you also return the task in Prolific so that others may take the survey.
    </p>

    <h1>About Account Linking</h1>
    <p>
        Users of online services can often link their accounts to products made by other companies, which can 
        operate on behalf of the user's account. For example, a user can link their Spotify account (i.e., a 
        music streaming service) to their Amazon Alexa (i.e., a voice-controlled smart speaker) in order to 
        play their favorite music.
    </p>
    <p>
        Your Gmail account, as a Google account, can also be linked in this way. In the following questions,
        we ask about how your Google account can similarly be linked to other (non-Google) services. Later we
        will use a web browser extension to do further analysis of how you may (or may not) link your Google
        account.
